# Conversation 3

**Alice:** Hey, Ben! How was your day after we left the Oxford library?

**Ben:** Hey, Alice! It was pretty good, actually. I can’t stop thinking about all the stuff we found on Romanian vampire lore. That library is incredible, isn’t it?

**Alice:** Absolutely! I was amazed at how much information they had. Some of those old texts were fascinating, especially the ones that talked about how the vampire myths started.

**Ben:** I know, right? I had no idea there were so many different types of vampires in Romanian folklore. The way they described them was so detailed. It’s a bit creepy, but also really interesting.

**Alice:** Totally. I was really drawn to the stories about the **strigoi**—how they’re supposed to be the spirits of the dead coming back to haunt the living. It’s so eerie!

**Ben:** Yes! And the idea that they could shape-shift and turn into animals like wolves or owls was something I hadn’t heard before. It makes you wonder how these stories spread and evolved over time.

**Alice:** For sure. And did you see those illustrations in the medieval manuscripts? They were so detailed. It really shows how seriously people took these legends back then.

**Ben:** Yeah, those were amazing. It’s incredible to think that these myths have influenced so much of what we see in modern vampire stories today. It all started from those old folk tales.

**Alice:** Exactly! I’m really glad we decided to go to the library. I feel like we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s there. We should definitely go back sometime.

**Ben:** Definitely. There’s still so much to learn. Plus, it was kind of fun to get lost in those old books, even if they were a bit dusty!

**Alice:** Haha, true! I don’t mind a bit of dust when the books are that interesting. Let’s plan another trip soon!

**Ben:** Sounds good to me. I’m already looking forward to it. Maybe next time we can check out that section on folklore from other countries too.

**Alice:** Great idea! It’ll be interesting to compare the vampire myths from Romania with other cultures. I’m sure there are some fascinating differences.

**Ben:** Absolutely. Alright, let’s make it happen. See you later, Alice!

**Alice:** See you, Ben! Can’t wait for our next adventure.
