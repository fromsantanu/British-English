#Script: The Bogus Crime Story**

---

**[Setting: A dimly lit bar. Two friends are sitting at a booth with drinks in front of them. The narrator, a man in his early 30s, leans forward with a sly grin as he begins his tale. His friend listens, intrigued but increasingly skeptical as the story progresses.]**

**Narrator:**  
Alright, man, listen up. You’re not going to believe this, but I’ve got a story for you. It’s wild. So, you know that old warehouse on the edge of town? The one they say is abandoned? Well, let’s just say… it’s not exactly *empty* anymore.

**Friend:**  
(Slightly intrigued) Yeah?

**Narrator:**  
Oh yeah. See, I’ve been keeping an eye on that place for a while now. Late nights, when nobody’s around. Turns out, there’s been some serious *activity* going on in there. And guess who figured it out? (Leans back, smugly) Me.

**Friend:**  
(Raises an eyebrow) Oh really?

**Narrator:**  
Absolutely. So, a few nights ago, I decided to take a closer look. You know, just to check things out. I sneak in through this side door—don’t ask me how I got in. Let’s just say I have my ways. (Smirks) Anyway, inside, it’s dark. Dead silent. But I could hear these faint footsteps, echoing. It was like something out of a spy movie. My instincts told me I wasn’t alone.

**Friend:**  
(Watching closely) Uh-huh...

**Narrator:**  
I followed the sounds, creeping through the shadows, when suddenly, I saw them. Two guys, dressed all in black, loading these… let’s call them *packages*… into the back of a van. It looked shady as hell. I’m talking high-end stuff—jewels, stacks of cash, all packed neatly in crates. The kind of operation you’d only see in movies.

**Friend:**  
(Leans in, interested) You actually saw that?

**Narrator:**  
(Confident) Oh yeah. But here’s where it gets crazy. I knew I had to act fast, right? So, I waited until they were distracted, then I moved in closer, keeping low, blending into the dark. My heart was racing, man. But then, I noticed something weird. One of the guys, he… he was talking on his phone, but it wasn’t in any language I’d ever heard before. 

**Friend:**  
(Slightly suspicious) Not in any language?

**Narrator:**  
Yeah, like, not one I could even guess. It was all gibberish, or some kind of code. That’s when I realized—this wasn’t just a local job. This was big. *International* big. I could feel it, you know? Like something huge was about to go down. And right at that moment, I knew I had two choices: get out of there and keep my mouth shut, or… stop them.

**Friend:**  
(Starting to doubt) Uh, okay…

**Narrator:**  
I know, I know, sounds nuts, right? But hear me out. I decided I couldn’t just walk away. So, I grabbed a—well, let’s call it a ‘tool’—from a nearby shelf. A wrench, yeah, that’ll do, and I snuck up behind them. I was just about to make my move when one of the guys turned around. Our eyes met, and I swear he saw *everything* in that split second. The tension was electric. I thought I was done for. But then—get this—he just… smiled.

**Friend:**  
(Skeptical) Smiled?

**Narrator:**  
(Shrugs, trying to cover up) Yeah! Smiled, like… he knew something I didn’t. But here’s where it gets really strange. I blacked out. Just like that. One minute I’m there, ready to make a move, and the next? Nothing. Pitch black. When I woke up, I was back at my apartment, no memory of how I got there. Like it never happened.

**Friend:**  
(Clearly doubting) Hold on… you blacked out?

**Narrator:**  
(Sensing the doubt) Yeah, it’s crazy, right? But here’s the thing—the next morning, I checked the news. The warehouse? Completely burned down overnight. No sign of anything. No crates, no van, nothing. It’s like they wiped everything clean, like they knew I was there and needed to erase all traces. But trust me, man, it was real. I saw it all.

**Friend:**  
(Pauses) And you’re sure…?

**Narrator:**  
(Starting to falter) Yeah… I mean… look, maybe some details are a little fuzzy, okay? But the main part—that happened. I swear. I mean, the blackout part, that’s probably just, uh… adrenaline or something. Yeah, that’s it. You know how it is when you’re in a high-stress situation. But everything else? I’m telling you, it was real.

**Friend:**  
(Raising an eyebrow) Uh-huh…

**Narrator:**  
(Quickly changing the subject) Anyway, the point is… I was there, man. Right in the middle of it all. And I’m telling you, there’s more going on in this town than we realize. I’ve got my eyes open now. Who knows what I’ll uncover next.

**[The friend sips his drink, clearly doubtful, while the narrator leans back, trying to appear casual but clearly aware that his story didn’t quite land.]**
