# Story Narration 2

**[Setting: A dimly lit living room. Two friends, one a middle-aged man (the narrator), sit on a couch with a cup of tea in hand. The room is filled with an eerie silence as the man begins his story. The friend listens with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.]**

**Narrator:**  
You’re not going to believe this, but I had the most terrifying experience last night. I’m still shaking just thinking about it. It all started when I decided to take a late-night drive to clear my head. You know how I love those quiet drives, especially when I need to unwind.

**Friend:**  
(Mildly curious) Yeah, I remember.

**Narrator:**  
Exactly. So, there I was, driving down this old country road I’d never taken before. It was pitch dark, and the only light came from my headlights. The trees on either side of the road seemed to close in around me, casting these long, creepy shadows. But, I didn’t think much of it. I just kept driving, enjoying the solitude.

**Friend:**  
(With a slight shiver) Sounds a bit eerie.

**Narrator:**  
It was, but you know, I kind of like that sort of thing. Anyway, as I was driving, I noticed this old, abandoned house off to the side of the road. You know the type—broken windows, overgrown weeds, and a faded ‘For Sale’ sign barely hanging on. Something about it just drew me in. I thought, “Why not take a closer look?” I know, stupid, right?

**Friend:**  
(Laughs nervously) Yeah, maybe just a bit.

**Narrator:**  
So, I parked the car and got out. The air was thick with fog, and it was so quiet. I could hear every step I took crunching on the gravel. As I approached the house, I noticed that the front door was slightly ajar, creaking with the breeze. Now, I should have turned around right there, but curiosity got the better of me.

**Friend:**  
(Concerned) Oh no, don’t tell me you went inside!

**Narrator:**  
Oh, I did. I pushed the door open, and it let out this loud, creaky sound that sent shivers down my spine. Inside, it was even darker, but I had my phone’s flashlight with me. I could see the dust hanging in the air, and every piece of furniture was covered in white sheets, like something out of a horror movie. I felt this chill run down my back, but I kept going, drawn deeper into the house.

**Friend:**  
(Tensing up) What did you find?

**Narrator:**  
At first, just the usual abandoned stuff—old chairs, a broken table, and some family photos lying on the floor. But then, I heard it. This faint whispering sound, like someone calling my name. I froze. My heart was pounding. I thought maybe it was just the wind, but then I heard it again, clearer this time: “Get out…”

**Friend:**  
(Whispering) Oh my God…

**Narrator:**  
I know! I shined my flashlight around, but there was nothing. The voice kept repeating, “Get out… get out…” My hands were shaking so badly, I almost dropped my phone. But I still couldn’t move. It was like my feet were glued to the floor. And then, out of nowhere, a shadow darted across the hallway right in front of me.

**Friend:**  
(Startled) No way!

**Narrator:**  
Yes! I swear, it was like a dark figure just zoomed by. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I finally snapped out of it and decided to get the hell out of there. But as I turned around, I felt this cold breeze brush past me, like something—or someone—had walked right through me.

**Friend:**  
(Speaking quickly) You didn’t stay, did you?

**Narrator:**  
Are you kidding? I ran as fast as I could! But as I reached the door, it slammed shut with a force that nearly knocked me over. I was trapped! I banged on the door, screaming for help, even though I knew no one could hear me. And then, the whispering started again, only this time it was all around me, coming from every direction.

**Friend:**  
(Covering mouth) That’s terrifying!

**Narrator:**  
I thought I was done for. But then, out of nowhere, the door swung open, almost hitting me in the face. I didn’t waste a second—I bolted out of that house and straight to my car. When I got in and slammed the door, I saw something in my rearview mirror—a shadowy figure standing in the doorway, just watching me.

**Friend:**  
(Whispering) What did you do?

**Narrator:**  
I floored it. I didn’t look back. I drove straight home, shaking the whole way. And you know what’s the craziest part? When I got home, I noticed a piece of old paper stuck to my windshield. I pulled it off, and it was a photo—the same one I’d seen on the floor of that house. A family, but with one face scratched out. I don’t know who—or what—put it there, but I’m never going back to that road again.

**Friend:**  
(Looking horrified) I don’t blame you. That’s the stuff of nightmares.

**Narrator:**  
Tell me about it. I’m still trying to make sense of it. But one thing’s for sure: some things are better left alone. I’m sticking to my usual routes from now on. No more curiosity for me!

**[The friends sit in stunned silence for a moment, the weight of the story lingering in the air, as the room seems to grow colder.]**
