# Conversation 2

**Alice:** Good morning, Ben! How’s university treating you today?

**Ben:** Good morning, Alice! The usual stuff. I have lectures back-to-back all day. It’s a bit of a grind. How about you?

**Alice:** I know what you mean! I had an early seminar this morning, and now I have a lot of reading to get through. Honestly, it feels like it never ends.

**Ben:** I totally get it. My coursework is piling up, and I have this group project that’s driving me crazy. No one seems to be doing their part.

**Alice:** Oh, that’s the worst! There’s always someone in the group who doesn’t do any work. Have you talked to your tutor about it?

**Ben:** No, I think I’ll just push through it. Sometimes it’s not worth the trouble, you know? How’s your dissertation going, by the way?

**Alice:** Slowly but surely. I’m still in the research phase, going through endless journals. I swear, if I read one more article about 18th-century literature, I might just lose it.

**Ben:** Sounds like loads of fun! I’m still trying to decide on my topic. I can’t choose between two ideas, and my supervisor isn’t much help.

**Alice:** Typical! They always say they’re there to guide you but then leave you to figure it out yourself. What are the two ideas?

**Ben:** Well, one is about social media’s impact on mental health, and the other is on the history of public transport in London. Kind of random, I know.

**Alice:** Not random at all! They both sound interesting. Go with whichever one you’re more passionate about, I’d say.

**Ben:** Yeah, maybe you’re right. I’ll think about it. Want to grab a coffee later and complain more about uni?

**Alice:** Always up for a good chat! How about after my tutorial at two?

**Ben:** Perfect. I’ll meet you at the usual spot. Don’t get lost in those journals, okay?

**Alice:** Ha! I’ll try not to. See you soon, Ben!

**Ben:** See you, Alice!
