### Scene 1: **Conversation with a Potential Supervisor**

**Priya (emailing a professor):**  
Dear Professor Williams,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Priya, and I hold an MSc in Health Data Science from Central University in India. I am currently visiting Oxford University to explore the possibility of pursuing a PhD here. 

I’ve come across your research on healthcare data analysis and its implications on public health policies, which aligns closely with my research interests. I would love to discuss potential PhD opportunities under your supervision and hear your insights on how my research could contribute to your ongoing work.

Would you be available for a short meeting or a call during my visit to Oxford?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,  
Priya

**Professor Williams (replying):**  
Dear Priya,

Thank you for reaching out. Your background and interests sound like an excellent fit for the work we are doing at Oxford. I would be happy to discuss potential opportunities for PhD research. 

Let’s arrange a meeting during your visit. I am available on Friday at 2 PM. Does that work for you?

Best regards,  
Professor Williams

**Priya (replying):**  
Thank you, Professor Williams. Friday at 2 PM works perfectly. I look forward to our conversation.

Best regards,  
Priya

### Scene 2: **Conversation with the Graduate Admissions Office**

**Priya (walking into the Graduate Admissions Office):**  
Good afternoon! I’m Priya, a prospective PhD applicant, and I wanted to gather some information about the application process.

**Admissions Officer:**  
Good afternoon, Priya! We’re happy to help. Have you looked into the PhD programs you’re interested in, or are you here for general advice?

**Priya:**  
I’ve been exploring the health data science programs, and I’ve already reached out to a potential supervisor. I’d like to understand what the application process looks like, especially for international students.

**Admissions Officer (nodding):**  
That’s great to hear! For PhD programs, we require a few key documents: your research proposal, academic transcripts, a CV, letters of recommendation, and a personal statement. As an international student, you’ll also need to provide proof of English proficiency unless your previous studies were conducted in English.

**Priya:**  
That makes sense. I completed my MSc in English, so I assume that would be enough for the language requirement?

**Admissions Officer:**  
Yes, that should be sufficient, but I would recommend checking with the specific department just to confirm. The deadlines vary, but generally, you should submit your application at least six months before your intended start date. And don’t forget to look into scholarships and funding opportunities.

**Priya:**  
Thank you, that’s very helpful. Is there any flexibility on submitting recommendation letters? I’m waiting on one from a former professor.

**Admissions Officer:**  
We do allow some flexibility as long as the rest of your application is complete by the deadline. You can upload the letter when it becomes available.

**Priya:**  
Great! I’ll make sure to keep that in mind. I also wanted to ask about living arrangements and student accommodation options.

**Admissions Officer:**  
We offer graduate accommodation, but many students opt for private housing, depending on availability and preference. I would recommend applying for accommodation as soon as you receive an offer, as it fills up quickly.

**Priya:**  
Thank you so much for your guidance!

**Admissions Officer:**  
You’re welcome! Feel free to contact us if you have more questions during the process.

### Scene 3: **Conversation with a Current PhD Student**

**Priya (meeting up with Sarah, a current PhD student):**  
Hi Sarah, thank you for taking the time to meet me! I’m considering applying for a PhD at Oxford, and I wanted to get a student’s perspective on what it’s like.

**Sarah (smiling):**  
No problem at all, Priya! I’m happy to help. So, what would you like to know?

**Priya:**  
I’ve read about the academic side, but I wanted to know more about the day-to-day life of a PhD student here. How do you balance your research with everything else?

**Sarah (nodding):**  
It’s definitely a challenge, but it’s manageable if you plan well. Most of my time is spent either in the library or in the lab, but there are also seminars, workshops, and department events that keep things interesting. Oxford’s a vibrant place, so it’s important to take breaks and enjoy the city too.

**Priya (curious):**  
What’s the supervision process like? Do you meet your supervisor regularly?

**Sarah:**  
Yes, I meet with my supervisor about once a month, though it varies depending on the stage of your research. Early on, you’ll have more guidance, but as you progress, it becomes more independent. That said, you’re never really on your own – there’s a strong support system here.

**Priya:**  
That’s reassuring. I’m also concerned about funding. How did you go about securing yours?

**Sarah:**  
I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship from the Clarendon Fund, which covers tuition and living costs. There are other scholarships as well, and some departments have their own funding. I would definitely recommend applying for as many as you can.

**Priya:**  
Thanks, Sarah. This is really helpful. Do you have any advice for someone just starting the application process?

**Sarah (laughing):**  
Yes – start early! Make sure your research proposal is clear and aligns with your potential supervisor’s work. And don’t be afraid to ask questions. Oxford can feel intimidating, but it’s a really welcoming place once you get settled.

**Priya:**  
That’s great advice. I feel more confident about the process now.

### Scene 4: **Conversation with the Scholarship Office**

**Priya (over the phone):**  
Hello, I’m Priya, and I’m inquiring about funding opportunities for international PhD students. Could you provide some information on the scholarships available?

**Scholarship Officer:**  
Hi, Priya! Certainly. We offer several scholarships for international students, including the Clarendon Fund, Rhodes Scholarship, and some department-specific grants. The Clarendon Fund is highly competitive, but it covers tuition fees and provides a living stipend.

**Priya:**  
That sounds ideal. What’s the application process like for the Clarendon Fund?

**Scholarship Officer:**  
When you apply for a PhD at Oxford, your application is automatically considered for the Clarendon Fund, so you don’t need to submit a separate application. However, we recommend ensuring your academic achievements and research proposal stand out, as it’s based on merit.

**Priya:**  
That’s good to know. Are there any external funding sources you’d recommend for healthcare-related research?

**Scholarship Officer:**  
Yes, there are several external fellowships and government grants available for healthcare and data science research. I would suggest checking the Commonwealth Scholarships or Wellcome Trust funding for healthcare initiatives.

**Priya:**  
Thank you for your help. I’ll look into those options as well.

**Scholarship Officer:**  
You’re welcome! Good luck with your application, Priya.

### Scene 5: **Conversation at the Visa Office**

**Priya (visiting the visa office):**  
Hi, I’m Priya, and I’m exploring the possibility of studying for a PhD at Oxford. Could you guide me through the student visa process for international students?

**Visa Officer:**  
Of course! Once you receive an unconditional offer from the university, you’ll be issued a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) number, which you’ll need to apply for your student visa. You’ll also need to provide proof of funding for your tuition and living expenses.

**Priya:**  
What are the financial requirements?

**Visa Officer:**  
You’ll need to show that you can cover the tuition fees for your program, and additionally, you must have at least £1,334 per month for living expenses if you’re living in Oxford for 9 months or longer.

**Priya:**  
That’s helpful. What about the healthcare requirements?

**Visa Officer:**  
As part of your visa application, you’ll need to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), which grants you access to the NHS for the duration of your stay. The IHS fee is currently £470 per year for students.

**Priya:**  
Great, I’ll start preparing the necessary documents. Thank you!

**Visa Officer:**  
You’re welcome! Make sure to apply as soon as you receive your offer to avoid any delays.
