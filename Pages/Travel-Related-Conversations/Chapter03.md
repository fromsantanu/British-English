### Scene 1: **At the Entrance of the Restaurant**

**Sam (smiling):**  
Priya! It’s so good to see you again. How’s everything been since you arrived?

**Priya (smiling back):**  
Uncle Sam! It’s great to be here. Everything’s been wonderful so far. The weather is so different from back home.

**Sam (laughing):**  
Welcome to the British weather! You’ll get used to it eventually. Come on, let’s get inside and have some lunch. I’ve made a reservation.

### Scene 2: **Inside the Restaurant – Ordering Lunch**

**Waiter:**  
Good afternoon. May I take your order?

**Sam:**  
Yes, could we start with some water, please? And let’s have a look at the menu.

**Waiter:**  
Of course, here you go.

**Sam (to Priya):**  
So, what are you thinking? Do you want to try something local?

**Priya (glancing at the menu):**  
Hmm, yes. I’d like to try something traditional. Maybe the fish and chips?

**Sam:**  
Good choice! I’ll have the steak and ale pie.

**Waiter:**  
Got it. Fish and chips for you and the steak and ale pie for you, sir. Would you like any sides with that?

**Sam:**  
Some mashed potatoes on the side, please.

**Waiter:**  
Perfect. I’ll get that started for you.

### Scene 3: **Waiting for the Meal – Discussion on PhD Plans**

**Sam (leaning forward):**  
So, Priya, how are you feeling about everything? You’ve come here to visit, but I know you have bigger plans, right?

**Priya:**  
Yes, actually. This visit is more than just a family trip. I’m trying to get a feel for the environment here, especially at Oxford University. I’m seriously considering applying for a PhD here on my next visit.

**Sam (nodding):**  
That’s fantastic! Oxford is one of the best places in the world for research. Have you thought about what your area of focus will be?

**Priya:**  
I’m leaning towards something in healthcare, maybe health data science. I’ve always been passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, and I feel Oxford has the resources and expertise to support that kind of research.

**Sam:**  
You’re absolutely right. The university has incredible facilities, and there are so many opportunities to collaborate with experts across disciplines. Have you spoken to anyone in the department yet?

**Priya:**  
Not yet, but that’s part of why I’m here. I want to meet some professors and researchers and see what their work is like. I’ve already made a list of people I’d like to reach out to.

### Scene 4: **Meal is Served**

**Waiter (placing the dishes):**  
Here you go. Fish and chips for you, ma'am, and the steak and ale pie with mashed potatoes for you, sir. Enjoy your meal.

**Priya:**  
This looks delicious, thank you.

**Sam (taking a bite):**  
So, are you planning to apply for next year’s intake?

**Priya (nodding):**  
That’s the idea. I’ll need to finalize my research proposal soon. I want to make sure it aligns with the ongoing work here.

**Sam:**  
Good plan. I’m sure the professors will appreciate your proactive approach. Have you considered the funding options yet?

**Priya:**  
Yes, that’s something I’m looking into as well. There are a few scholarships for international students, and I might also explore government grants. I’ll need to be strategic about it.

**Sam:**  
You’re thinking ahead, and that’s smart. I know the process can be competitive, but with your background, you’ve got a great chance.

### Scene 5: **Ordering Dessert**

**Waiter (returning):**  
How was everything? Would you like to see the dessert menu?

**Sam (glancing at Priya):**  
What do you think, Priya? Feeling like something sweet?

**Priya (smiling):**  
Why not? Let’s see the menu.

**Waiter:**  
Here you go. Today’s special is sticky toffee pudding.

**Priya (excited):**  
That sounds amazing! I’ll have that.

**Sam:**  
And I’ll take the apple crumble with custard, please.

**Waiter:**  
Excellent choices. I’ll be right back with your desserts.

### Scene 6: **Discussing Plans Further over Dessert**

**Priya (tasting the sticky toffee pudding):**  
This is so good! I’m definitely going to miss British desserts when I leave.

**Sam (smiling):**  
You’ll have plenty more if you’re here for your PhD. So, what’s next on your agenda for this trip?

**Priya:**  
I’m planning to visit the university campus tomorrow and take a tour of the libraries and research centers. I’ve heard the Bodleian Library is a must-see.

**Sam:**  
Oh, it absolutely is. And don’t forget to explore the town a bit. Oxford is a city steeped in history, but it’s also very modern in its academic culture. You’ll feel right at home.

**Priya:**  
That’s what I’m hoping. I want to make sure I’m comfortable with both the academic environment and the city before I fully commit to the PhD.

**Sam:**  
It’s smart to do your homework before diving in. But knowing you, I’m sure you’ll thrive here.

### Scene 7: **Finishing the Meal and Leaving**

**Waiter (placing the bill on the table):**  
Whenever you’re ready, sir.

**Sam:**  
I’ve got this, Priya. Don’t worry about the bill.

**Priya (smiling):**  
Thank you, Uncle Sam. I really appreciate it.

**Sam:**  
It’s my pleasure. So, after lunch, any plans?

**Priya:**  
I’m just going to take a walk around the city, maybe visit a few shops. And then I’ll head back to Mimi’s place.

**Sam (getting up):**  
Sounds like a nice afternoon. Well, let’s get going. I’ll walk with you for a bit before I head back to work.

**Priya:**  
That sounds great!

### Scene 8: **Exiting the Restaurant**

**Sam (holding the door open):**  
I’m really glad you’re considering Oxford for your PhD, Priya. I think it’s the perfect place for you.

**Priya:**  
Thanks, Uncle Sam. I’m excited about the possibilities. I’ll keep you posted on how things go!

**Sam:**  
You’d better! Good luck with your meetings tomorrow, and let me know if you need anything while you’re here.

**Priya:**  
I will. Thanks again for lunch!

**Sam:**  
Anytime, Priya. Let’s catch up again soon.

**Priya:**  
Definitely!
