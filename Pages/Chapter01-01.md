**Alice:** Hey, Ben. How’s it going?

**Ben:** Not bad, thanks. How about you?

**Alice:** I’m good, but I’ve been pretty tired lately. Work has been really hectic.

**Ben:** Oh, I know what you mean! I’ve been really busy too. What’s been happening with you?

**Alice:** Just the usual stuff. My boss keeps pressuring me about this project. I feel like I’m always chasing my own tail.

**Ben:** That’s typical! They never give you a break, do they? What’s the project about?

**Alice:** It’s some marketing campaign, nothing special. But they want everything done by next week. No pressure, right?

**Ben:** Wow, that sounds pretty intense. If you need any help, just let me know.

**Alice:** Thanks, Ben. I might take you up on that offer. How about you? How’s everything going for you?

**Ben:** Nothing too exciting, really. Just trying to keep up with everything. I have a few deadlines coming up, but nothing I can’t manage.

**Alice:** Sounds like we both need a break. Do you want to grab a drink at the pub later?

**Ben:** Definitely! I could use a good catch-up. Does 6:30 work for you?

**Alice:** Perfect. I’ll see you then. And don’t be late this time!

**Ben:** Me, late? Never! See you soon, Alice.

**Alice:** See you, Ben. Take care!
